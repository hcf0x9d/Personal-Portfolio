# My Personal Portfolio

Hi all.  This is an ever-evolving project.  I generally use this as a playground for trying out new features and techniques.  Often I do a quick redesign of my site, then develop it in even less time in order to get an update out the door.

I hope to one day have this project something worth showcasing for its OOP skills or otherwie, but until then.  It is what it is.
